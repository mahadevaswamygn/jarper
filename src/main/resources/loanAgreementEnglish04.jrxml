The interest will be computed based on the principal outstanding balance on a daily basis. This interest amount will be debited to the facility account itself thereby recovering the interest component of the EMI. Excess funds over and above the EMI deposited by the Borrower/s into the account will be adjusted against the principal outstanding, unless instructed by the Borrower to consider it as an advance EMI. On the other hand, if sufficient funds are not deposited into the account then the interest debited will show as an unauthorized overdraft and the account will be categorized as a delinquent account.]]></text>
