Should any applicable law at any time require any deduction or withholding to be made from a payment, Borrower’s liability in respect of the payment shall be for a revised amount which the Company would have received, had no such deduction or withholding been made. The Borrower also confirms that any withholding tax obligation, in respect of the interest payable on the facility whether under the Indian Law or the Laws of any other country applicable to the Borrower, would be the Borrower’s responsibility. The Borrower shall hold the Company harmless and fully indemnified for any claim which may be made in this regard by any tax or other authorities and undertake to pay forthwith any such demands which the Company may be made liable to pay. If the Borrower fails to pay the amount so demanded by the Company, then the Borrower hereby authorizes the Company to enforce the security created in their favour for the purpose of recovery of the said tax amount in certain cases or authorizes the Company to treat the same as paid on their behalf and debit such amount to the Borrower’s Loan account.]]></text>
